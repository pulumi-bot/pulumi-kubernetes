    PathType determines the interpretation of the Path matching. PathType can be one of the following values: * Exact: Matches the URL path exactly. * Prefix: Matches based on a URL path prefix split by '/'. Matching is
      done on a path element by element basis. A path element refers is the
      list of labels in the path split by the '/' separator. A request is a
      match for path p if every p is an element-wise prefix of p of the
      request path. Note that if the last element of the path is a substring
      of the last element in request path, it is not a match (e.g. /foo/bar
      matches /foo/bar/baz, but does not match /foo/barbaz).
    * ImplementationSpecific: Interpretation of the Path matching is up to
      the IngressClass. Implementations can treat this as a separate PathType
      or treat it identically to Prefix or Exact path types.
    Implementations are required to support all path types. Defaults to ImplementationSpecific.
