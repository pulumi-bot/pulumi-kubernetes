class Job(dict):
    """
    Job represents the configuration of a single job.

    This resource waits until its status is ready before registering success
    for create/update, and populating output properties from the current state of the resource.
    The following conditions are used to determine whether the resource creation has
    succeeded or failed:

    1. The Job's '.status.startTime' is set, which indicates that the Job has started running.
    2. The Job's '.status.conditions' has a status of type 'Complete', and a 'status' set
       to 'True'.
    3. The Job's '.status.conditions' do not have a status of type 'Failed', with a
    	'status' set to 'True'. If this condition is set, we should fail the Job immediately.

    If the Job has not reached a Ready state after 10 minutes, it will
    time out and mark the resource update as Failed. You can override the default timeout value
    by setting the 'customTimeouts' option on the resource.
